# Analysis Notebooks
This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks that explore the meterological data downloaded by the scripts in the `scripts` directory for the Skagit River basin.

Some generated plots and figures are stored in the `figures` directory, but most of the analysis is done in the notebooks themselves.

1. The `Analysis_Playground.ipynb` notebook is a general playground for exploring the data.
2. `ProductAnalysis_Precip.ipynb` notebook explores precipitation data from various sources.
